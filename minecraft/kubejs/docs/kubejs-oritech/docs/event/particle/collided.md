# Particle Collided Event

This event allows you to invoke logic when a particle collides in the [Particle Accelerator](../../recipe/machine/particle_accelerator.md). Colliding refers to controlled particle movement that results in a successful collision. For particles that exit the accelerator without colliding, refer to the [particle exited event](exited.md).

> [!WARNING] NOTE
> This event only exists since mod version 1.21.1-0.3.0, release date: 2026-02-06.

**It is a server event and reloadable!** Keep in mind that server events have to be located inside the `kubejs/server_scripts` folder.

## Overview

This event is fired when a particle collision happens in the Particle Accelerator, but before checking if the collision matches a valid recipe. By cancelling the event, the collision will still happen, but not result in any item output, which is the samee thing that happens when no valid recipe is found.

## Oritech Recipe

The instance you obtain when using the `recipe` property is an `OritechRecipe`. This type is reused for all Oritech recipes, so it is not as straightforward to use. The following shows available properties you can call on the recipe instance to get its data.

All properties and functions, that are not listed here, should not be used and are intended for internal use.

```js
// obtains the time of the recipe in ticks
let time = recipe.time

// obtains the input ingredients of the recipe as list
let ingredients = recipe.inputs
let firstInput = ingredients[0] // get the first input ingredient

// obtains the output item stacks of the recipe as list
let results = recipe.results
let firstResult = results[0] // get the first output item stack
```

Because this type is reused for all Oritech recipes, the inputs and outputs use lists, even if this specific recipe only has two inputs and a single output. Make sure to unwrap the list to invoke logic on specific elements.

## Event Listener

To access the event, the first thing you need to do is to open an event listener for the `particleCollided` event in a server script.

```js
OritechEvents.particleCollided(event => {
    // ...
})
```

After that, you can apply logic to modify the particle collision behavior.

## Example

```js
OritechEvents.particleCollided(event => {
    // obtaining all properties of the event by destructuring
    let { level, pos, controller, collisionPos, itemA, itemB, speed, recipeId, recipe } = event

    // if the recipe id is null, there was no recipe meaning unmatched items have collided
    if (recipeId == null) return

    // disable particle collision for a specific recipe
    if (recipeId === "mymodpack:particle_accelerator/recipe1") {
        event.cancel()
    }
})
```
